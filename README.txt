# ece228project
This dictionary is for ECE228 project code and dataset. 

In this dictionary, dataset is used in binary classification task with VGG16,ResNet50 and IncepetionV3.

And dataset3 is used in mutiple classification task with VGG16,ResNet50 and IncepetionV3.

Folder dataset_two_class is used in binary classification task with ResNet18. This folder has the same content with the folder dataset but in different form.

Folder dataset_three_class is used in mutiple classification task with ResNet18. This folder has the same content with the folder dataset3 but in different form.

For every jupyter notebook in this dictionary, you can simply run it with all dataset folders I mentioned above.

For the following jupyter notebooks, you should run them with python3 and tenserflow environment:

1. VGG16_binary.ipynb(This is the binary classification task using VGG16.)
2. VGG16_multiple.ipynb(This is the multiple classification task using VGG16.)
3. ResNet50_binary.ipynb(This is the binary classification task using ResNet50.)
4. ResNet50_multiple.ipynb(This is the multiple classification task using ResNet50.)
5. IncepetionV3_binary.ipynb(This is the binary classification task using IncepetionV3.)
6. IncepetionV3_multiple.ipynb(This is the multiple classification task using IncepetionV3.)

For the following jupyter notebooks, you should run them with python3 and pytorch environment:
1. ResNet18_binary.ipynb(This is the binary classification task using ResNet18.)
2. ResNet18_multiple.ipynb(This is the multiple classification task using ResNet18.)

You'd better restart the server before each run to clear memory.
